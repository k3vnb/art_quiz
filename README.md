# Art Quiz

## Description
jQuery based quiz app that leads users through a quiz of matching famous artworks to the artists who created them.

The javascript is broken out into modular, re-usable functions and most of the HTML is rendered dynamically via javascript.

The styling is created to be responsive and consistent across screen sizes.

### Stretch goals
With more time, it would be great to build this app out a bit more with smoother transitions between card views, more questions (maybe levels from easy to hard), and maybe connect to a database so users can log in and keep scores across a range of all kinds of quiz topics (sculptures, architecture, etc).

I'd also like to spend some time optimizing photo loading (as it is, some pictures lag on render).
